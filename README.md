This is a lightweight dynamic league table web app which was built with the intention to keep a record of wins, draws and losses on the Pokemon TCG Online game amongst friends.

However this is completely extendable as it was built with generic-ness in mind so that it could be reskinned for any sort of league, be it in sports or other competitive games.

## Features

- Inline editable AJAX cells so that values can be updated on the fly
- The table is sorted in real time by current row's score 
- The score is automatically calculated by the wins, draws and losses cells
- Add, delete and update cells without a single page reload
- Ability to reset the season so that all values are set back to 0

## In the future

When time is on my side I plan to dockerize this dotnet/react application so as to make it more portable and less reliant on server setup.
